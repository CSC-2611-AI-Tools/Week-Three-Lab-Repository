    "### Conclusion\n",
    "To conclude, when we set the group size of birthdays to 20 birthdays, we find the probability of atleast two people having the same birthdays to be 0.42, given that the number of simulations is at 1000. When we run the `smallest_group_size()` method to find the smallest group size, we set the number of simulations to 1000, and we found that the size of the group should be 24, and no matter the increase in the number of simulations, the number 24 stays constant. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is known as the Birthday Paradox. The Birthday Paradox, states that in a group of people the probability of two individuals sharing the same birthday which exceeds 50% is 24. We set the threshold for the probability calculations where the probability must be greater than 0.5. No matter by how much we increase the number of simulations, the number is always 24, which means the program is consistent and robust, and isn't erroenous, given the testing with increasing numbers of simulations."
